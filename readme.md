# Web Navigation Extension

This extension's primary use is to provide tips for navigating the web day-to-day. While this is the intended purpose, it doesn't limit itself, and you, the user, can fully customize it. Use it as a reminder, a way to avoid malicious sites, a bookmark, or even in the workplace to warn and communicate with another user. The options are nearly limitless in what you can do and achieve.

## üìã Features Implemented (Present)
- Can display pop-ups under the right conditions.
- Can delete pop-up messages if not needed.
- Can add pop-up messages to certain sites if users want to.
- Can delete users' messages and existing messages if they are annoying to the user.
- Easter Eggs: Try searching for "Dark Souls," "Monster Hunter Rise," "Cats," "JavaScript," and many more hidden in my code.

## üöÄ Future Feature Implementations
- Can detect ads and warn users that they may be scams.
- Users can add their own Easter Eggs in the popup.
- Using a database instead of relying on Chrome local storage.
- Chrome Store implementation.
- Xbox achievement-like animation on the tooltip popup.
- Much better UI.
- Using time to create a tooltip.
- Notification if Chrome is closed.
